# Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition 
The notebook contains a basic handwritten digit recognizer using **numpy library**.

I have implemented a simple single hidden layered neural network that achieves over 95% accuracy.

I have used [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for training and testing the neural network. The data is provided in *csv* format.

In the architecture of Neural Network we have following layers:
- Input Layer having 784 units
- Hidden layer having 256 units
- Output layer having 10 units
